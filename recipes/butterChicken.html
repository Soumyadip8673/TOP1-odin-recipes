                <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1-inch piece ginger, grated</li>
                <li>1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
               <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Steps</h3></li>
            <ol>
               <li><strong>Marinate the chicken: </strong>In a large bowl, combine yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, cumin, coriander, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and mix well to coat. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for better flavor.</li>

               <li> <strong>Cook the chicken:</strong> Heat butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>

               <li><strong>Make the gravy: </strong> In the same skillet, add the onion and cook until softened. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in the diced tomatoes and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the tomatoes break down.</li> 

                <li><strong>Simmer and add cream:</strong> Add the heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Cook for 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.</li>

                <li><strong>Combine chicken and gravy: </strong>Return the cooked chicken to the gravy and simmer for a few minutes more, to allow the flavors to meld.</li>

                <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve hot with basmati rice or naan bread.</li>
               
            </ol>
