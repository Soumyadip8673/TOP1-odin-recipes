        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Gulab Jamun</strong> is a popular Indian dessert that consists of deep-fried dough balls soaked in a sweet syrup flavored with rosewater and cardamom. The dough balls are typically made with milk powder, all-purpose flour, ghee, and a few other ingredients.
           </p>

          <p> The deep-frying process gives the gulab jamuns a golden-brown exterior and a soft, chewy interior. The sweet syrup, flavored with rosewater and cardamom, adds a delightful aroma and taste. Gulab jamuns are often served warm and are a beloved dessert in many Indian households.</p>
