        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Rasmalai </strong> is a rich and creamy Indian dessert made with soft, spongy cottage cheese balls soaked in a fragrant milk-based syrup. The cottage cheese balls, often called "malai," are typically made by kneading together crumbled paneer, milk powder, and cardamom powder.</p>

          <p> The syrup, which is made from milk and sugar, is often flavored with cardamom and saffron, giving it a delicate and aromatic taste. The combination of the soft, spongy cottage cheese balls and the rich, creamy syrup makes rasmalai a luxurious and indulgent dessert.</p>
