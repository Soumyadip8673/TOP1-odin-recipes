        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><strong>Fish Pakora </strong> is a popular Indian appetizer that consists of deep-fried pieces of fish coated in a flavorful batter made of gram flour (besan), spices, and water. The batter gives the pakora a crispy exterior, while the fish inside remains tender and juicy.</p>

          <p> The combination of the crispy batter and the flavorful fish makes fish pakora a delicious and satisfying starter. It's often served with dipping sauces like mint chutney or tamarind chutney to enhance the taste.</p>
